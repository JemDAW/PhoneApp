# This app retrives the data of phones from a Node API, displays it in a column and let's you see more information from the device you select clicking on a button.
# The node app uses Express and you should run it (with command "node server.js") first of all, so the server runs in http://127.0.0.1:3000 .
# The react app needs Axios install and you should run it after the Node server (with command "npm start"), so you can see it in  http://localhost:3001 .
